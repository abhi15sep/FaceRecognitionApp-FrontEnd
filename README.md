# FaceRecognitionApp
- FaceRecognitionApp made by React and Node.
- After you sign up, you can post a link of a picture with a face, and my app can detect that face and put in a square.
- This app is still on progres, right now it allows only for one face, but I will change it soon.
- There is also a repo for backend (https://github.com/firattale/FaceRecognitionApp-Backend)
- It uses the Clarifai API (https://clarifai.com/)

- Still on progress
